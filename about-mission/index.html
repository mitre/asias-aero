                <h2 class="heading">Enhancing Safety Through Collboration</h2>
                <p>
                In 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the aviation industry launched <strong>a collaborative safety 
                analysis and data sharing initiative known as Aviation Safety Information Analysis and Sharing (ASIAS).</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                For many years, the aviation industry realized that <strong>risk-based assessments must be the foundation of 
                safety-related decisions.</strong> Further, for data collection programs to be comprehensive and e!ective, the aviation 
                industry recognized that all stakeholders—government, manufacturers, operators, and employee groups—must 
                establish a reporting culture based on trust and focus on proactive mitigation of adverse outcomes. ASIAS is 
                built on these beliefs. The dedicated safety professionals who created this initiative established mechanisms and
                forums for sharing data. Most importantly, they <strong>established trust among stakeholders by guaranteeing that 
                sensitive data would be used only to advance safety in accordance with the guiding principles of the ASIAS 
                program.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Today, ASIAS leverages proprietary safety data from operators, manufacturers, publicly available records, and 
                other aviation industry sources to <strong>monitor known risks, evaluate the e!ectiveness of deployed mitigations, and 
                identify emerging hazards.</strong> ASIAS stakeholders provide data, help contextualize it during analyses, and 
                collectively draw conclusions and establish best practices.  
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading">The Guiding Principles</h2>
                <ol type="I">
                <li>ASIAS information is used solely for the identification, monitoring, and mitigation of system-wide
                safety issues. It is not used punitively.</li>
                <li>ASIAS stakeholders voluntarily submit safety-sensitive data.</li>
                <li>Data is de-identified to preserve anonymity.</li>
                <li>Roles and responsibilities of ASIAS stakeholders are developed collaboratively.</li>
                <li>ASIAS data use is transparent to all stakeholders and supporting organizations.</li>
                <li>The United States Aerospace Safety Team (USAST) is responsible for safeguarding the trust
                stakeholders have placed in ASIAS. Further, the USAST assures the integrity and relevance of
                each analysis through careful deliberation.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="callout">
                ASIAS has enabled the aviation community to transition from a reactive approach for managing safety to a forward-looking, proactive approach.
                It is an active and robust example of how dedicated collaborative data sharing initiatives can have a positive impact in advancing safety.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading">Collaborative Private-Public Partnership</h2>
                <p>ASIAS a collaborative data sharing partnership between the aviation industry and FAA/U.S. Government. It is a 
                first of its kind collaborative program focused on safety data analysis and sharing. Since ASIAS&rsquo;s inception, <a href="https://www.mitre.org">The 
                MITRE Corporation (MITRE)</a> has served a trusted partner to government, industry, and academia in shaping and
                operating ASIAS. MITRE is uniquely positioned to serve as the prime partner for ASIAS due to its proven ability to
                ensure:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>All data submitted by stakeholders is owned by the submitting stakeholder and will not be directly accessible
                by any other stakeholder.</li>
                  <li>There is no actual or perceived conflict of interest &mdash including commercial interest &mdash in the stakeholders 
                data or the partnership itself.</li>
                  <li> Stakeholders expectations codified in the ASIAS agreements are honored &mdash including protecting 
                stakeholders data from improper use/disclosure and respecting intellectual property and other equities &mdash based 
                on long-standing legal/compliance practices and security and privacy controls honed on decades of experience 
                safeguarding highly sensitive data</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="heading">What does ASIAS Do?</h2>
                
                <h3 class="subheading">1. Collect</h3>
                <p>
                The ASIAS process begins with the intake, integration, and de-identification of aviation safety data, such as, 
                text-based and digital flight data. The data collection stage also involves &ldquo;fusing&rdquo; data—including safety report 
                data with flight recorder and surveillance data—to create a wholistic &ldquo;flight story.&rdquo; Crucially, ASIAS protects 
                proprietary data through de-identification of information, such as names used in safety reports, ensuring the 
                focus remains on addressing systemic safety issues in a non-punitive manner.
                </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">2. Analyze</h3>
                <p>
                ASIAS analyzes de-identified proprietary data to gain insight on 
                safety issues in the National Airspace System (NAS) from a 
                variety of perspectives.

                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Safety Issue Identification</strong> is analysis to identify and 
                  understand systemic safety issues before they contribute to
                  an accident or incident. Potential issues are identified 
                  through tips from the field and by applying artificial 
                  intelligence and machine learning analytical capabilities to 
                  reveal patterns in ASIAS data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Directed Studies</strong> in collaboration with the United States 
                  Aerospace Safety Team (US AST) are comprehensive 
                  examinations of underlying contributing factors and 
                  existing barriers of systemic safety issues. The results are 
                  shared with government and industry safety teams, such as 
                  the United States <strong>Commercial Aviation Safety Team (US 
                  CAST) and the United States General Aviation Joint Safety 
                  Committee (US GAJSC)</strong>, to develop voluntary mitigations 
                  and reduce the likelihood of accidents and serious 
                  incidents in the future.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <h3 class="subheading">3. Monitor</h3>
                <p>
                ASIAS monitors known aviation safety risks through analytical metrics, which provide ASIAS stakeholders and 
                safety teams with the basis for system-wide decision-making.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Benchmarks</strong> allow operators to compare their operational data against an aggregate de-identified norm.</li>
                <li><strong>Metrics</strong> allow safety teams to monitor safety trends, detect safety issues, and assess e!ectiveness of 
                implemented safety enhancements.</li>
                </ul>
                Benchmarks and Metrics are shared with stakeholders via the <strong>ASIAS Portal</strong>, an online platform for participants 
                to stay up to date on aviation safety concerns.
                <h3 class="subheading">4. Collaborate</h3>
                <p>Once a potential systemic safety issue is identified, the <strong>ASIAS Safety Issue Working Group (SIWG)</strong> conducts an 
                initial evaluation of the issue. The SIWG collaboratively shares findings with the United States Safety Assurance 
                Team (USSAT), enabling the USSAT to decide to submit the safety issue to the Aerospace National Safety Issue 
                Registry (ANSIR) and to proceed with further analysis. As needed, safety teams further study the safety issue for 
                future action, including (but not necessarily limited to) a safety risk assessment of an accident or serious 
                incident.
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>ASIAS also collaborates internationally.</strong> For example, ASIAS has shared detailed safety metric definitions as well 
                as aggregate, de-identified results to Regional Aviation Safety Groups (RASGs) in Pan-America (PA) and Asia 
                Pacific (APAC).
                </p>
                <h3 class="subheading">Connect</h3>                
                <div class="inline-img float-right">

                  <dfn>The ASIAS Lifecycle</dfn>
                </div>
                  <p>
                ASIAS conducts outreach to new aviation communities (e.g., rotorcraft) 
                and domains (e.g., aircraft maintenance organizations and dispatch 
                operators) to increase program participation.
                </p><p>
                Additionally, <strong>Aviation Safety InfoShare</strong> meetings, attended by 
                government and aviation industry members, provide a unique 
                opportunity for organizations to share safety issues and best practices 
                to help raise awareness across the aviation community. ASIAS 
                leverages the knowledge gained at InfoShare to search its data 
                repositories to identify potential systemic safety issues.
